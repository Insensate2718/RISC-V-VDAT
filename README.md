RISC-V VDAT SoC Tapeout Program
Overview
This repository contains files, documentation, and progress updates for the RISC-V VDAT SoC Tapeout Program, a hands-on initiative focused on designing RISC-V-based System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. The program covers the full design process from RTL to GDSII using open-source tools.
About the Program
The VDAT SoC Tapeout Program is a collaborative effort to advance India's semiconductor ecosystem. It provides practical experience in chip design, helping participants develop skills for industry-ready solutions using RISC-V technology.
